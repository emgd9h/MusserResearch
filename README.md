## Working with Mizzou Robotics
- I was invited to work with Mizzou Robotics this semester after I was trained by Chris Scully, like I said on the form I think attending these meetings was very beneficial for me as it was a great chance for me to meet with some people that were already more experienced with Spot than I was but also was a chance for me to meet people that were similar to me in experience so I could learn, test around, and brainstorm with them as well. 
### HelloSpot.py
- I uploaded the Hello spot file from the example programs that we got from Boston Dyanmics, this was really the starting point for seeing how to actually code Spot to do things in a certain way and order upon running a program. Reading through these example programs and understanding specifically this one was the basis for beggining to work on the "dance routine" that Mizzou Robotics was working on. 

### Spot Twitch Stream
- The last idea that we started to look into on the side outside of Mizzou Robotics was using the Rasberry Pi to send the footage of Spots cameras to a server and then forward that to live stream it onto twitch. From here we were also thinking about adding a way to control the 360 degree camera to utilize its powerful zoom features. This could be tied with a few other ideas in the future like taking Spot on campus tours, to football games, and other cool outreach events.
